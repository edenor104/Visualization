Visualization of Information Course:

Final Project: When Vision Lies - Navigating Virtual Environments with Unreliable Visual Information

Here you can find all the code used to make the visualization in the project report. 
You can also find the conference paper this work is based on. We recommend reaing it to better understand the paradigm and results. 

All the interactive visualizations could be found in the following link: https://visualization-1.onrender.com/

The conference paper and the code that processed the data and created the interactive graphs could be found here : https://github.com/edenor104/Visualization

To better understand the paradigm, data and results please check the OSF website for more details. There you can also find the notebook used to create the non-interactive graphs under “VisualizationGraphs.ipynb”. If you wish to experience the paradigm you could do so by running the exe. file in the repository under the experiments folder. (https://osf.io/jbwd2/)
